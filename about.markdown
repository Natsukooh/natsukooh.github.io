My name is Romain Baudet, 21 years old, 5th year IT student, in cybersecurity specialization.  
__I am looking for a job in the domain of cybersecurity. I'll be available starting in september 2023.__

## Work experiences

__june 2022 - august 2022__: internship in [INRiM][inrim-website], Torino, Italy  
Description of the job: INRiM is an Italian national physics research institute. There are 5 IT people managing the whole IT infrastructure of the institute. I helped one of them, and developped internal tools for the institute.

__march 2023 - present__: internship in [NXP semiconductors][nxp-website], Mougins, France.
Description of the job: NXP produces multiple different SoC (System on a Chip), but they all have the ARM architecture in common. ARM CPUs have a security isolation feature called ARM-trustzone, that makes both a non-secure and a secure execution context, both isolated from each other. To use this hardware architecture, a software called TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is necessary. I am working on making NXP's SoC a new standard called PSA (Platform Security Architecture).

## Languages

__French__: native language
